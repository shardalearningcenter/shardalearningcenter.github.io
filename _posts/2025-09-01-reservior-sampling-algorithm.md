# Lottery Analogy for Reservoir Sampling (k = 1)

Imagine you are running a lucky draw at a fair.

People come in one by one.

You must always keep exactly one name in your box.

You donâ€™t know how many people will come.

# Step by step:

## First person (A) comes â†’ you put A in the box (no choice, itâ€™s empty).

Box: [A]

## Second person (B) comes â†’
You flip a fair coin:

Heads â†’ replace A with B.

Tails â†’ keep A.

Now, <mark>A and B both have equal chance (50%).</mark>

### Third person (C) comes â†’
You roll a 3-sided dice (imagine).

If it lands on side 1 â†’ replace box with C.

Otherwise (2 or 3) â†’ keep the old one (A or B).

ðŸ‘‰ Now A, B, C each have equal chance (1/3).

### Fourth person (D) comes â†’
Roll a 4-sided dice.

If side 1 â†’ replace with D.

Otherwise keep old one.

ðŸ‘‰ Each of A, B, C, D has equal chance (1/4).
